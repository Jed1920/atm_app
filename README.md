ATM App

When the console app is run it will require the total number of $20 notes and $50 notes to be input as the initial balance of the atm

Following this there are three options 

Deposit – Input the number of $20 and $50 notes to be deposited into the atm
Withdraw – Input the amount desired and it will return the number of $50 and $20 denominations that can make that sum, prioritizing the use of $50 notes first and then $20
Total – Return the total number of $20 and $50 notes and the total balance
